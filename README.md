# CS-230 Operating Platforms

The Draw it or Lose it is a multi-user gaming application. The client wanted it on different plaforms ranging from mobile devices like Android, to desktop clients like Windows. Analyzing the requirements helped in breaking down the scope of the project into individual modules, classes, etc. This in-depth approach also helped in understanding the userâ€™s needs and making sure they were included a solution. It was important that the game could have multiple teams with each team having multiple team members. When it comes to the Design Document, I believe that I did a good job of analyzing the client requirments and specifying what they wanted to be built. I also think that I did a good job of recommending storage/memory solutions to have enough storage/memory for the game to run correctly. Working through the Design Document allowed me to look at this project like a puzzle and allowed me to understand each requirement, implement it, and move on to the next required feature. One part of the document that I would like to revise is the security section because I feel that I could learn more about this topic and then have a more informed opinion for a recommendation. What I have learned when designing software that I will use in the future is really focusing on the requirements that the client has and breaking it up into small manageable pieces and getting one to work and then building upon it.
